Welcome to Coperr's Documentation!
==================================

This is the official documentation for `coperr-lang <https://github.com/MonliH/coperr-lang>`_.
Coperr is a dynamically typed programming language implemented in `Python 3 <https://www.python.org/>`_.
It is inspired by C++, C, Java, and mainly Python.

Design Principles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Be easy to read.** Copper has been designed to be easy to read, and easy to learn.
  It is similar to Python 3, making it easier to learn for those who know the language.

- **Be faster then Python 3.** Coperr has a pure python implementation, which means you can use modules like `Pypy <https://pypy.org/>`_ and `CPython <https://github.com/python/cpython>`_.
  Use of Pypy or CPython can possibly make it even faster the normal Python 3 (even though it is written in Python 3).

- **Have a consistent syntax.** Copper's syntax was designed to be elegant and consistent. It does **not** have many exceptions/inconsistencies as far as syntax is concerned.

- **Be different.** You might be thinking, why would I ever use this over Python (or some other programming language)?
  It's just another language to learn, and it provides the same features as a lot of programming language.
  That's where your wrong. I am is currently implementing a powerful new programming paradigm that will boost your productivity and make your want to use Coperr!
